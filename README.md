# AndroidLAnimations
Compilation of Material Design and Animations with RecyclerView

The project uses Material design styles and themes and is tested till Android 4.0

------------------------------------------------------------

There are primarily two fragments :

a) BasicFragment

  Several Features have been implemented here
  i)    Use of Recycler View with Card View
  ii)   Use of Default Animations for Recycler View Remove/Delete feature
  iii)  Use of Custom "slide in from left" Animation for the recycler view list when app is started
  iv)   Use of Swipe to Delete (drag the image to right) for deleting a row
  v)    Use of Snackbar for validation when a delete is completed
  vi)   Expand Recycler View with animation when the text is touched
  vii)  Use of Floating button library for adding a row
  viii) Use of Ripple Animation library for ripples whenever button, or actionable text is touched
  xi)   Use of the Reachability library for Reachability feature (from iOS)

b) Advance Recycler Fragment
   
   This is a work in progress to use the wonderful library from Haruki Hasegawa, https://github.com/h6ah4i/android-advancedrecyclerview, this is to play around with drag and drop, swipe and expand features
